# MesSecGuard-4: Intrusion Detection System for Mesh Networks

## Overview
MesSecGuard-4 is a custom-built Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for mesh networks. Leveraging advanced cybersecurity techniques and artificial intelligence, it aims to provide a proactive defense mechanism capable of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential threats dynamically.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to address the complex security challenges inherent in mesh networks and develop an IDS optimized for their unique requirements. Our focus is on real-time traffic analysis and threat detection, particularly targeting SYN flood attacks and port scans.

## Background
Mesh networks, characterized by their distributed architecture and reliance on wireless communication, present unique cybersecurity challenges. MesSecGuard-4 was developed in response to the escalating need for a security framework adaptable to these networks.

## Accomplishments
- **Research and Development**: Conducted in-depth research on existing IDS solutions, leading to the design of a Python-based IDS for mesh networks.
- **Implementation**: Successfully deployed the IDS, utilizing libraries like pcapy for packet capturing and Scapy for detailed packet analysis.
- **Testing and Validation**: Rigorously tested the system to ensure its effectiveness in detecting security breaches, fine-tuning algorithms to minimize false positives.

## Future Directions
The project plans to enhance the IDS by incorporating more sophisticated AI models and expanding its threat detection capabilities, ensuring that mesh networks remain secure as they continue to proliferate.
